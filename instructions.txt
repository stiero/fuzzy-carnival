Exploratory Data Analysis

Pls find attached anonymized transaction-wise sales data of a retailer with this email. 
The dataset contains date, SKU code, brand, category, bill number, store code, sales qty, 
MRP and SP (selling price), and a sale / return flag. It's right now in 9 different files. 

We need you to analyze this sales data with the following in mind:

    - There can be anomalies / issues in the data e.g. sometimes the Sales Price is more 
    than MRP, or some duplicate entries - would need you to identify them and deal with them
    
    - When you identify any trend / pattern, e.g. store XYZ is the highest selling store, 
    then we expect you to dig a little deeper to see if that is due to some 
    particular category or brand, or whether it is during a particular set of month
    
    The key metrics to analyse are:
        - Discount percent by store and month - deep dive by categories
        - Sales qty by store and month - deep dive by categories
        - Avg. selling price of product by store and month - deep dive by categories
        - No. of unique SKUs sold by each store and month - deep dive by categories

Forecasting

We need you to forecast the weekly demand (sales qty) for Store 5. Here, you will need to 
take reasonable assumptions regarding some features and apply some thoughts around what 
features to create and which technique to use (ARIMA/ARIMAX vs. Linear Regression vs. 
Decision Trees vs. LSTM). Pls share your feature engineering and choice of technique along with the rationale for it.
